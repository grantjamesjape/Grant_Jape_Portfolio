  - "node_modules"
  - "Gemfile"

# Analytics/Custom Includes
# ----------------
# By ensuring the `_includes/head.html` file exists (as we created in the last step),
# your analytics code (which is inside `_includes/analytics.html`) will be
# reliably injected into the <head> section of every page.
